AERIAL IMAGE ANALYSIS FOR SMART CITY DEPLOYMENT
(General Purpose Image/Video Annotation for Large Scale Computer Vision)

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
## ðŸ“Œ Features 
As we know that urban littering , rooftop tank and waterbodies significantly contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases in densely populated cities. These conditions directly undermine
public health, increase disease outbreaks (e.g., dengue, malaria),and strain healthcare systems . Traditional monitoring methods are labor-intensive and lack scalability. 
To address this, we leverage high-resolution drone imagery and computer vision-based annotation techniques to automatically detect and classify public health risks. This data-driven approach enables proactive health monitoring and supports smarter, more resilient urban development strategies. 
To built a model  we need annotated images so that model can be trained using that images and then by itself  detect it  on new images .â€‹

â€‹In this project we have tried to annotate the images in three broad categories 
1. Urban Littering (polygon annotation)
2. Rooftop tank (boundingbox or polygon)
3. Waterbodies (polygon annotation)

    ## ðŸ”§ Requirements
   1. Docker software
   2. CVAT or LABEL STUDIO
   3. WSL (if user runs on windows)
   4. Python 3.9+
   5. OpenCV
